# HigherLowerGame-with-YouTube-Live-chat
YouTube live chat controlled game for http://www.higherlowergame.com/ 

This code can be used to open and control [Higher Lower Game](http://www.higherlowergame.com/).
I used brave browser to avoid any advertisments in between.

## STEPS:
```
Install webDriver for your browser, required packages
Change webDriver location and provide your stream URL
Run code
```

Words like high and higher, low and lower would be counted for 30 seconds and which ever will be higher would be clicked.
If both are equal last vote(high or low) will be considered.
